Coding Environment
- The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
 - ReactJS v18.2
 - NextJS v15
 - TypeScript v5.6
 - TailwindCSS v3
 - HTML
 - CSS

Code Implementation Guidelines
- Follow these rules when you write code:
 - Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
 - Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
 - Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
 - Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
 - Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
 - Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

ChangeLog
- take note of the current version
- create proper changelog for every changes, like google engineer!
- we will be working on branches, so changes will be merged and release into the master branch
- temporary file should be named after the branch name (alpha-numeric only) prefix with "CHANGELOG" and suggestion if it's a patch or minor or major release. Suggest a version release based on CHANGELOG.md

Test
- for every added features, pages and functionality, create a test
- pages should be tested that DOM is loading and all expected elements are loaded

NOTES.md
- if there are future things to do, update NOTES.md
- if you have suggestions, check an updated NOTES.md
- if features and updates are in TODO.md, update NOTES.md of the branch or version it was updated
- add test for simulating form submission

UserModel
- always refer to @UserResource.php for the UserModel insterface
- for UserModel.profile, it's dynamic key-value rows save as @UserAttribute.php
