# Avatar Feature Fixes Summary
## SSL Certificate Issue Fix

The application was encountering SSL certificate errors when loading avatar images from the backend API with self-signed certificates. We implemented the following changes to resolve this:

1. Added `httpsAgent` with `rejectUnauthorized: false` to axios requests to bypass certificate validation in development:
   - Updated API avatar proxy endpoint (`pages/api/avatars/[filename].ts`)
   - Added to avatar upload endpoint (`pages/api/avatars/upload.ts`)
   - Modified main axios instance (`lib/axios.ts`) to apply globally

2. Fixed URL handling:
   - Improved environment variable usage for API URLs with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
   - Fixed variable naming in proxy endpoints to avoid redeclaration issues

## Avatar URL Path Improvement
We changed the avatar URL pattern from `/api/avatars/filename.jpg` to `/avatar/filename.jpg` for a cleaner URL structure:

1. Created new Next.js pages at the new paths:
   - `/avatar/[filename].ts` for serving avatar images
   - `/avatar/upload.ts` for handling uploads

2. Implemented utility function:
   - Created `/utils/avatar.ts` with `getAvatarUrl()` to standardize URL formatting
   - Updated `FileUpload` component to use the utility
   - Modified `userService.ts` to apply the function to all avatar URLs

3. Maintained backward compatibility:
   - Added redirects to ensure existing code continues to work
   - Ensured both URL formats are supported during the transition

## Test Fixes
Fixed the test suite to work with the updated avatar-related components:

1. Updated test mocks:
   - Used virtual mocks for dependencies with import issues
   - Fixed AvatarUpload tests to properly mock the utility functions
   - Added proper cleanup in tests

2. Improved Jest configuration:
   - Enhanced the global Jest setup to better handle modules with dynamic imports
   - Fixed missing module reference issues in test files

## API Endpoint Configuration

1. Fixed the endpoint configuration in `userService.ts`:
   - Corrected the `AVATAR_V2` endpoint URL to match the backend API
   - Ensured consistent environment variable usage across files

## Error Handling

1. Improved error handling throughout avatar-related functionality:
   - Added better error logging and user feedback
   - Enhanced error response formatting for API requests 


## [0.6.3] - Minor Release  2025-04-21

## Flat URLs Structure

### Changed
- **Routes**: Removed `dashboard` or `admin` prefix from routes for even cleaner URLs
  - `/admin/users` → `/users` 
  - `/admin/settings` → `/settings`
  - Keep `/dashboard` as the main dashboard page

### Added
- Added new root-level pages:
  - `/users.tsx` - User management
  - `/settings.tsx` - Application settings
  - Maintained `/dashboard.tsx` as the main dashboard

### Updated
- Updated `layouts/admin.tsx` to use new route paths
  - Modified sidebar navigation links to point to root-level routes
  - Updated active link detection logic
- All redirects and navigation links now use the new URL structure
- Maintained backward compatibility for links to `/dashboard`

### Pending
- Additional tests will need to be updated to reflect the new routing structure
- Other admin-related functionality (products, etc.) should use the flat URL structure 

## Migration Guide
No database changes are required. This is purely a UI/routing change. All internal links have been updated to use the new flat URL structure, improving the user experience with cleaner and more intuitive URLs.
