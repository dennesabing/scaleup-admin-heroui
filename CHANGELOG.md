## [0.6.2] - Minor Release  2025-04-21

## Flat URLs Structure

### Changed
- **Routes**: Removed `dashboard` or `admin` prefix from routes for even cleaner URLs
  - `/admin/users` → `/users` 
  - `/admin/settings` → `/settings`
  - Keep `/dashboard` as the main dashboard page

### Added
- Added new root-level pages:
  - `/users.tsx` - User management
  - `/settings.tsx` - Application settings
  - Maintained `/dashboard.tsx` as the main dashboard

### Updated
- Updated `layouts/admin.tsx` to use new route paths
  - Modified sidebar navigation links to point to root-level routes
  - Updated active link detection logic

### Pending
- Additional tests will need to be updated to reflect the new routing structure
- Other admin-related functionality (products, etc.) should use the flat URL structure 

## Migration Guide
No database changes are required. This is purely a UI/routing change. All internal links have been updated to use the new flat URL structure, improving the user experience with cleaner and more intuitive URLs.
