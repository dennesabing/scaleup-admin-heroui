feat: add automated release scripts and versioning

- Add bash script (release.sh) for Unix/Linux/Mac users
- Add PowerShell script (release.ps1) for Windows users
- Add Node.js script (release.js) for platform independence
- Update package.json with release script commands
- Add release process documentation to README.md

These scripts automate the process of creating release branches, 
updating version numbers, tagging releases, and merging to master,
ensuring a consistent release process across the team.
